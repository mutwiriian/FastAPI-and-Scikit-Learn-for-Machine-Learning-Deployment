## FastAPI-and-Scikit-Learn-for-Machine-Learning-Deployment
Machine Learning models when built are not meant to sit inside a Notebook
They are built so that they can be applied in the real world by instatatenoeusly
making predictions. In this project, I not only build a machine learning model, but I go a step further to deploy it as an API with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/lo/) so 
that it can be integrated into existing sytems or services as an endpoint. The endpoint receives requests in real time
and generates responses. 

This project also features user management with role-based access for different uses using [SQLAlchemy](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/tutorial.html)

##Set up
To run the service ensure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed

Run 

`git clone https://github.com/mutwiriian/FastAPI-and-Scikit-Learn-for-Machine-Learning-Deployment.git`

Then 

`cd temp_fastapi`

To install all the packages and other dependencies required to run the service run: 

`poetry install`

Activate the environment by running 

`poetry shell`

Go to [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for installation instructions

To run the app open the terminal and run the `main.py` file
