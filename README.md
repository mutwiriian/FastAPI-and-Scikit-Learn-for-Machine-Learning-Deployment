## FastAPI-and-Scikit-Learn-for-Machine-Learning-Deployment
Machine Learning models when built are not meant to sit inside a Notebook
They are built so that can be applied in the real world in order to instatatenoeusly
make prediction. In this project, I not only build a machine learning model, bit I go a step further to deploy it into so 
that it can be integrated into existining sytems or services as an endpoint. The endpoint receives requests in real time
and generates responses. 

##Set up
To run the service ensure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed

Run 

`git clone https://github.com/mutwiriian/FastAPI-and-Scikit-Learn-for-Machine-Learning-Deployment.git`

Then 

`cd temp_fastapi`

To install all the packages and other dependencies required to run the service run: 

`poetry install`

Activate the environment by running 

`poetry shell`

Go to [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for installation instructions

To run the app open the terminal and run the `main.py` file
